\title{
Calculates all descriptive statistics
}
\description{
Statistics are calculated using arithmetic and geometric Method of Moments (micrometer) and using logarithmic Folk and Ward (1957) Method (phi scale): mean, standard-deviation, skewness, kurtosis.
The mode(s) is(are) determined graphically by the user (with a maximum of 4 modes). The determination of the mode is optional (no determination by default).
Several percentiles and common index are calculated: D10, D50, D90, D90/D10, D90-D10, D75/D25, D75-D25, Trask(So) Index, Krumbein(Qd) Index.
Physical description of texture, sorting, skewness or kurtosis are provided as such as the sediment name after Folk (1954).
Are also included the percentage of particules falling into each predefined size fraction, modified from Blott and Pye (2001) scale, Udden (1914) and Wentworth (1922).
\kbd{granstat} is a function which provides all results organized in two ways: a complete matrix (by default) or by separate items.

\usage{
granstat(x, phiSize=FALSE, web_interface=FALSE, statistic = "all", modes = FALSE,
FromLargetoSmall=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A numeric matrix or data frame
}
  \item{phiSize}{
If TRUE, phi meshsizes are used . If FALSE, micrometer meshsizes are used 
}
  \item{web_interface}{
if TRUE, a simplified interface is displayed from your default web browser
}
  \item{statistic}{
Statistic used: "arithmetic", "geometric", "folk.ward", "all". If this argument is not used, all statistics are calculated
}

  \item{modes}{
If TRUE, the mode must be determinated graphically by the user. If FALSE, the mode is not determinated. If this argument is not used, no determination of the mode is proposed
}
  \item{FromLargetoSmall}{
If TRUE, sieves are odered from the larger to the smaller . If FALSE,
sieves are odered from the smaller to the larger.
}

}
\details{
For the determination of the mode (\kbd{modes=TRUE}).  All the samples are successively shown with a graph.
The user can choose graphically the mode (1 in 4 maximum) by a click on the graph.
If 4 modes are chosen, the following graph appears automatically.
If 1, 2 or 3 modes are chosen, the user has to use the function stop locator in the graphic window.

If the weight of sediment retained on the broadest sieve exceeds 5 percent of the total mass of the sample, the Folk and Ward statistics cannot be computed.
